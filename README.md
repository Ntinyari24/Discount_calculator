# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The program asks the user for the original price of the item and the discount percentage, and then it calculates the final price based on the discount.

## Features
- Accepts the original price and discount percentage as input from the user.
- If the discount is 20% or more, it applies the discount.
- If the discount is less than 20%, the original price remains unchanged.
- Handles invalid input gracefully by prompting the user for valid numbers.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the original price of the item and the discount percentage.
3. The program will calculate and display the final price after the discount (if any).
